Mary had a little lamb,
His fleece was white as snow,
And everywhere that Mary went,
The lamb was sure to go.
</p><p>
He followed her to school one day,
Which was against the rule,
It made the children laugh and play
To see a lamb at school.
</p><p>
And so the teacher turned it out,
But still it lingered near,
And waited patiently about,
Till Mary did appear.
</p><p>
"Why does the lamb love Mary so?"
The eager children cry.
"Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know,"
The teacher did reply.
